    An essential idea behind object-oriented programming is that solutions rise from the interactions between objects
    which are created from classes. An object in object-oriented programming is an independent unit that has a state,
    which can be modified by using the methods that the object provides. Objects are used in cooperation; each has its
    own area of responsibility.

    Each class can directly extend only one class. However, a class indirectly inherits all the properties of the
    classes it extends.

    You use the keyword /extends/ to inherit the properties of a class. The class that receives the properties is
    called the subclass, and the class whose properties are inherited is called the superclass.

    If a method or variable has the access modifier /private/, it is visible only to the internal methods of that class.

    way to directly access the variables identifier, manufacturer, and description, which are defined in the superclass
    Part.

    A subclass sees everything that is defined with the /public/ modifier in the superclass.

    If we want to define some variables or methods that are visible to the subclasses but invisible to everything else,
    we can use the access modifier /protected/ to achieve this.

        // ABSTRACT CLASS //
    /*
    Sometimes, when planning a hierarchy of inheritance, there are cases when there exists a clear concept, but that
    concept is not a good candidate for an object in itself. The concept would be beneficial from the point of view of
    inheritance, since it includes variables and functionality that are shared by all the classes that would inherit it.
    On the other hand, you should not be able to create instances of the concept itself.

    An abstract class combines interfaces and inheritance. You cannot create instances of them â€” you can only create
    instances of subclasses of an abstract class. They can include normal methods which have a method body, but it's
    also possible to define abstract methods that only contain the method definition. Implementing the abstract methods
    is the responsibility of subclasses. Generally, abstract classes are used in situations where the concept that the
    class represents is not a clear independent concept. In such a case you shouldn't be able to create instances of it.

    To define an abstract class or an abstract method the keyword /abstract/ is used.
